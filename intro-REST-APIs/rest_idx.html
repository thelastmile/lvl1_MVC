    <h2><a id="What_is_an_API_2"></a>What is an API?</h2>

    <p>An <strong><em>Application Programming Interface</em></strong> is a
    software service/resource for other software to interact with. <img alt=
    "API img" src="img/API.png" style="width:60%;"></p>

   
<h4>We can integrate existing software into our programs for:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Functionality</li>

        <li>User Information</li>

        <li>Program Data</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Who is providing APIs?</h2> 
        <p>In a survey report released by Layer 7, 86.5%
    of large organizations plan to have an API for open-consumption by 2018. By
    2013, 10,000 APIs were on the market, quadruple the number available in
    2010.
   </p>
    <p>Almost every mobile app uses APIs to retrieve and
    manipulate data from a database. 

     Here are just a few examples:</p>
     

     <img alt="Zap API img" src="img/zapapps.png"></p>

    <h3>Where to find them:</h3> 

    <p>Usually, just googling the company name
    with “API” or “REST API” will allow you to locate existing
    documentation.</p> 

     <p>Popular APIs on the web include Facebook, Twitter,
    Stripe and Google Maps.</p> 



    <h3>Why do companies provide APIs?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Providing SaaS or PaaS (Software/Platform as a Service) allows a
        company to remain integratable in emerging platforms and
        technologies.</li>

        <li>Mobile apps are an important frontier and factor heavily in daily
        rituals. Web is not the only important platform any more for
        developers.</li>

        <li>Third-party application with their content influences back to their
        brand and software.</li>

        <li>Maintain friendly relations with developers and demonstrate
        technical prowess.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Communicating with APIs</h2>  
   <p>A good metaphor for computer protocol is
    polite etiquette between humans. For courteous interaction, people interact
    according to certain accepted rules. For computers, these rules are even
    more specific, and we call them <b>protocols</b>. The most
    common protocol on the web <b>HyperText Transfer
    Protocol</b> (HTTP) specifies certain rules for the
    request-response cycle. Many companies choose to adopt HTTP as the protocol
    to access their APIs due to it’s ubiquity on the web.</p>

    <h3>HTTP REQUESTS</h3>  <p>When you type <b>http://</b> in your browser, you are
    essentially asking the browser to use the protocol “HTTP” when
    communicating information to the server. You are specifying that this is
    how your request will be formatted with the following properties:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</li>

        <li>Method</li>

        <li>Headers</li>

        <li>Body</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let’s take an in-depth look at each one. 
    <h4>URL</h4>
    <p>The url field<em>specifies a unique address for the resource you are trying to
    access</em>. A URL is URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) with the
    means to locate said resource. What this means is, that the URL is the most
    commonly used subset of URI’s due to providing accessibility to the actual
    said resource [full path and means to retrieve data], instead of just
    identifying it, like a less common URN (Uniform Resource Name).</p>

    <h4>Method</h4> There are four common methods which specify exactly what your
    HTTP request wants to do. The method is the “verb” of the request.
    <h5>GET</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Asks the server to retrieve a specified resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>POST</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Asks the server to create a new resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>PUT</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Asks the server to update an existing resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>DELETE</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Asks the server to delete an existing resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Headers</h4> <p>Include meta-data about a request, including time sent and
    size of request body.</p>

    <h4>Body</h4> <p>Contains the data that the client wants to send. The client has
    complete control over what to include in this part while the rest must
    follow a rigid HTTP protocol.</p>

    <p><img alt="HTTP img" src="img/HTTP.png"></p>

  <h3>HTTP Responses</h3>  
    <p>Instead of a method and URL, HTTP responses include a
    status code.</p>

    <h4>Status Codes</h4> <p>Three-digit numbers that contain unique information
    about the success of your request.</p>

   <h5>Common Values</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>200 : Successful request!</li>

        <li>404 : Not Found</li>

        <li>503 : Our website/server is currently down</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img alt="Response img" src="img/response.png"></p>

     <h3>Developer Tools: Network </h3> 
     <p>Let’s see HTTP requests in action. Navigate
    to your Developer Tools console and click on the Network tab. Then click
    around on any page, you should see the fields populate with requests as
    event handlers are triggered. <img alt="Network img" src=
    "img/Network.png" style="width:80%;"></p>

   <h2>AJAX for HTTP Requests - <i>Asynchronous Javascript And
    XML</i> </h2> 


     <p>Despite the name, use of XML to send data is
    not required, and HTML or JSON is often used instead - particularly with
    jQuery.
    <br>
     AJAX allows Web applications to send and receive data
    from a server asynchronously. Because these events happen in the
    background, they don’t interfere with the existing page’s display or
    behavior.</p>

   <h3>Why do we need AJAX?</h3>

    <p>Without AJAX, a web page would need to be completely reloaded for every
    change that takes place. That is quite inefficient and time consuming, and
    makes for a bad user experience. Think about your Gmail account–imagine
    that every time you wanted to see new messages, you had to refresh the page
    completely. All your messages would be requested again and the entire page
    (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) would be rebuilt as well. But that isn’t what
    happens. Instead, you can request only the new messages, and only update
    the relevant parts of the page. That’s a whole lot quicker. AJAX is not
    another programming language. It’s a technique that uses existing
    JavaScript functionality to make asynchronous requests.</p>

    <h3>Asynchronous</h3> 

    <p>The programming you have done so far has been synchronous. Perhaps the
    easiest way to think of this is that everything happens in order, and one
    process doesn’t start until the process before it finishes. With
    asynchronous programming, one part of your code can start running, and the
    rest of your code can keep going even if that first part isn’t finished.
    This is extremely useful for tasks that take a long time–for example,
    requesting information from a server.</p>

    <p>When your JavaScript code sends a request to a URL, and when it receives
    a response, a callback function can be triggered to handle the response.
    While waiting for the response, because AJAX is asynchronous, the rest of
    your JavaScript code can continue to execute, and when you receive a
    response, that event will trigger your callback function, which will then
    process the returned data.</p>

    <h3>What is JSON?</h3>
     
    <p>JSON stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”. A JSON
    file looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">{
    <span class="hljs-string">"book1"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"The Hobbit"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"author"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"J.R.R. Tolkien"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"nationality"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"English"</span>
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">"genres"</span>: [<span class=
"hljs-string">"fantasy"</span>]
    },
    <span class="hljs-string">"book2"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"Ender's Game"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"author"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"Orson Scott Card"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"nationality"</span>: <span class=
"hljs-string">"American"</span>
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">"genres"</span>: [<span class=
"hljs-string">"science fiction"</span>]
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

    <p>Note that in JSON, both the attributes and the values must be in
    double-quotes.</p>

    <p>Since the JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript syntax, it does not need
    to be translated or parsed to be used by JavaScript. You can still do
    something like:</p>
    <pre>
<code>var books = { <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span> }
console.log(books.book1.author.name);
console.log(books.book2.genres[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Do It Yourself</h4>

    <p>Create a new file called “books.json”. 
    <br>
     Inside, make a JSON
    object that holds at least three books.
    <br>
     Each book should have the
    following information:
<br>
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>

        <li>Author</li>

        <li>Genre Use a &lt;a href=&quot;<a href=
        "../resources/lib/jsonlintdotcom/index.html">JSON
        Validator</a> to ensure you have written proper JSON.
        </li>
    </ul>
